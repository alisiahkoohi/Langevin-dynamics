# Sampling with gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches

PyTorch implementation of [stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/publications/papers/stoclangevin_v6.pdf) (SGLD) and  [preconditioned SGLD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07666.pdf) (pSGLD), involving simple examples of using unadjusted Langevin dynamics and [Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023562417138) (MALA) to sample from a 2D Gaussian distribution and "banana" distribution.

## Script descriptions

`langevin_sampling/SGLD.py`: SGLD sampler.

`langevin_sampling/precondSGLD.py`: pSGLD sampler.

`langevin_sampling/samplers.py`:

* Implements `LangevinDynamics` class that given negative-log of unnormalized density function and starting guess, runs Langevin dynamics to sample from the given density.

* Implements `MetropolisAdjustedLangevin` class that given negative-log of unnormalized density function and starting guess, runs MALA to sample from the given density.

`examples/gaussian_LD.py`: Sampling from a toy 2D Gaussian distribution with unadjusted Langevin dynamics.

`examples/gaussian_MALA.py`: Sampling from a toy 2D Gaussian distribution with MALA.

`examples/banana_LD.py`: Sampling from a toy "banana" distribution with unadjusted Langevin dynamics.
